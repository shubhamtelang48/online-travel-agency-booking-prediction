# Online Travel Agency Booking Prediction

The booking process has changed dramatically over the past decade, with more guests choosing to book online rather than direct. While the accessibility of online travel agencies may increase exposure and demand for many hotels, it has been met with an increase in cancellation rates. While cancellations are a familiar foe of the hotel industry, it has been the advent of the "risk free cancellations" campaign put on by online travel agencies that have made it a damaging statistic worthy of a second look.


## Roadmap

- Firstly we have to import the pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seabron for EDA purpose
- Get the dataset from kaggle and with help of pandas dataframe we read the csv file
- Find any null values presents in dataset if yes then drop the null value or replace with mean of respective column.
- After that we find that it is the imbalanced dataset so we have to balanced the dataset.
- Then we have to do feature engineering.
  After feature engineering we have to do normalization.
- put our independent and dependent variable into test train split.
- By using sklearn import the model which we have to test.
- find the best model will give as the good accuracy and f1 score.
- In last find the 5 most important features 


- Add more integrations
